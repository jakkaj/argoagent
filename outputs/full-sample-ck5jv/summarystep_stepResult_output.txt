Bendigo is a city located in north-central Victoria, Australia and is the fourth-largest inland city in Australia. In 2022, it had a population of 103,818, making it the 19th largest city in the country. The city is administered by the City of Greater Bendigo and is surrounded by several smaller towns. The traditional owners of the area are the Dja Dja Wurrung people. Bendigo boomed in the 19th century due to the discovery of gold, significantly contributing to the Victorian gold rush. Even though the boom period ended in the early 20th century, Bendigo experienced renewed growth from the 1930s and has been a thriving regional centre since the completion of the Calder Freeway in 2009.
