Bendigo is a city in Victoria, Australia, situated about 150 kilometers northwest of Melbourne. With a population of over 103,818 as of 2022, it is the 19th largest city in Australia and the fourth largest inland city. The city is governed by the City of Greater Bendigo and is surrounded by smaller towns. The area was formerly owned by the Dja Dja Wurrung people until gold was discovered in 1851, triggering a gold rush and transforming the city into a major boomtown. Despite a temporary decline, the city experienced renewed growth from the 1930s and continues to be a significant regional centre. The city's population growth has been concentrated in suburban areas, and it has become one of the fastest-growing regional centres in Victoria following the completion of the Calder Freeway linking it to Melbourne in 2009.
